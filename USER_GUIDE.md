# Grow & Tell — User Guide 🌱

Grow & Tell is a garden planning and reflection app designed around real home-gardening workflows. This guide explains how to use each section of the app and how the pieces fit together.

## Getting Started

Grow & Tell does not require an account or sign-in.

From the landing page, select Start Planning or Dashboard to enter the dashboard. All data is stored locally in your browser, so progress is saved automatically on the same device.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is the central hub of the app. It provides quick access to all garden areas and high-level summaries, including:

- Beds
- Plantings
- Tasks
- Harvests
- Soil

Each section uses card-based layouts and modal interactions to keep the experience focused and easy to scan.

## Beds

Beds represent the physical garden spaces you’re working with.

## What You Can Do

- Add new beds with a name and size
- Edit existing beds and crops
- Delete beds when they’re no longer in use
- Delete crop when no longer in beds
- View all beds in a simple list layout

Beds act as the foundation for plantings and soil records.

## Plantings

Plantings track what is currently growing in each bed.

## What You Can Do

- View planting entries in a card-based layout
- Filter and scan history to see what was planted and when

Adding crops happens inside the Beds feature. The Plant Log is where you review planting activity.

## Tasks

Tasks help you plan and track ongoing garden work.

## What You Can Do

- Default tasks provide common seasonal and maintenance activities
- Custom tasks let you add your own one-time or recurring work
- Mark tasks as complete
- Edit or delete tasks
- View task status at a glance

Tasks are designed to support real maintenance routines without over-automation.

## Harvests & Plant Log

Harvests record what you’ve collected from your garden.

## What You Can Do

- Log harvested crops with quantity and unit
- Group harvests by category (e.g., leafy greens, fruiting veggies)
- View totals and summaries

Harvest data feeds into the Plant Log, giving you a historical view of what your garden has produced over time.

## Soil Records

Soil tracking is focused on clarity and practicality.

- Each bed can have one soil record
- Soil records include:
- Amendments (such as compost or nutrients)
- Soil test (optional)

## Each test includes:

- pH
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Date tested

Only the latest test is shown on the soil card

## Soil Summary

- The dashboard summary shows:
- How many beds have been tested
- Which nutrients are currently deficient
- Nutrient status is derived from test values rather than manually entered labels

This design reflects real gardening behavior, where testing is occasional and decisions are made based on current conditions.

## Data Storage

- All data is stored locally in your browser using local storage.
- No login required
- No external services
- Data persists between sessions on the same device
- Clearing browser storage will reset the app

## Accessibility & Design Notes

Grow & Tell was built with accessibility and usability in mind:

- Keyboard-navigable interfaces
- Focus management for modals
- Clear error states and form validation
- Intentional empty states and disabled actions
- Responsive layouts for desktop and mobile

## Resetting or Starting Over

To reset the app completely, clear your browser’s local storage for the site. This will remove all saved data and return the app to its initial state.

## Final Notes

Grow & Tell is intentionally scoped and complete. It prioritizes clarity, reflection, and real-world gardening habits over feature overload or automation.
